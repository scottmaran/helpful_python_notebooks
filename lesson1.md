# Lesson 1: Familiarizing Yourself with your Computing Environment

When a person thinks of sports analytics, the first thing that comes to mind is statistics. And this is rightfully so. However, almost an equal part of the job is being able to statistics at scale, and computers are great for this. With computing becoming more powerful and useful across all domains, it is imperative that a sports analyst is comfortable on the computer. 

## Operating Systems

*unfortunately this guide is tailored to Mac and Linux users. Windows users...sorry*

A computer's operating system is what controls and manages your computer. When you open your laptop, you're meet with a nice GUI (graphical user interface) that is very intuitive to work with. You can see and click on all your folders and documents on the desktop and open them from there. But this is just exacctly what the acronym GUI stands for - an interface that makes it easier for the user to connect with the computer. If you want better control of your computing environment, you're going to need to get familiar with the command line.

### Command Line

The command line (or shell, terminal, prompt, etc.) is a text interface with your computer. On a Mac, it's called the terminal. You can access it by typing 'terminal' in spotlight search:

*my terminal might look a little fancier than yours because of a an open-source design plugin called Oh-My-Zsh I installed

Anything you can normally do on a computer you can do with the terminal. Open a text file, search a directory, open your favorite web browser.

You can do much more with it though! You're data, tools, and code have to be stored somewhere on your computer and creating a clean workspace you're familiar with is vital.

## Setting up Your Python Environment

Using the command line, we can install Python and set up a workspace for us to code. 

## Creating your Project Directory

Now that we have python installed, 

## Important Bash Commands

The first and most important commands you learn are 'cd' and 'ls'


```console
cd ~/Documents
```
